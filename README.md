## Introduction

This lab focuses on fine-tuning the GPT-2 transformer model for text generation. GPT-2, developed by OpenAI, is a state-of-the-art language model known for its ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. In this lab, we'll utilize the `pytorch-transformers` library to load the pre-trained GPT-2 model and fine-tune it on a customized dataset.

## Part 1: Fine-tuning the Pre-trained Model

1. **Loading the Pre-trained Model**: We'll start by loading the pre-trained GPT-2 model using the `pytorch-transformers` library.
2. **Custom Dataset Creation**: You can generate your own dataset for fine-tuning the GPT-2 model. This dataset should ideally be representative of the type of text you want the model to generate.

3. **Fine-tuning Process**: Using the customized dataset, we'll fine-tune the pre-trained GPT-2 model. Fine-tuning involves updating the model's parameters on the new dataset to adapt its knowledge to the specific task at hand.

## Part 2: Text Generation

1. **Generating Text from Seed**: Once the model is fine-tuned, we can utilize it to generate new text. Given a starting sentence or seed text, the model will predict and generate the subsequent paragraphs based on the learned patterns in the fine-tuned data.
